Past Projects: \u00b6 Complex Protein's Contact Predictions Drug Drug Interaction Predictions Protein Side Chain Chi1 Angle Predictions Complex protein's Contact Predictions \u00b6 Updated: 2021.10.01 This project is supervised by Prof. Jinbo Xu from Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago . Part of the code can be accessed here , full code will be available soon. Details: There has been a huge success recently on predicting proteins' structure. However, all the model mainly focused on single chain protein (protein only consists of one chain). How to better predict a complex protein's (protein consists of two or more chains) structure is the targeted problem here. Most of the protein structure prediction algorithms in the field or what most researcher trying to achieve, is to predict protein structure solely from its sequence. And the common approach or up until now, the golden standard, is to generate multiple sequences alignments (MSA) for the seqeunce. However, complex proteins, which have more than one sequences, can easily generate MSA for each sequence but for the whole complex proteins' sequences remains a challenge (because there are seperate chains), or should we even indulge the idea of still having an MSA for the complex proteins? The current approach is to concatenate each chain's MSA to form a complex protein's MSA. In this way, we could use the model developed for single chain proteins to complex proteins. The main obstacle is how to concatenate MSAs into one MSA. Suppose a complex proteins has two chains, each chain has 10 MSA, then there are a totol of 100 combinations, And it's order of the concatenation might matter, so a total of 200 permutations. The total amount of MSA is going to be huge. Filtering out good combination is the key. The approach to filter out good combination is to only combine MSA that are closer in genomic distance (the genetic coding region is close) or closer in phylogenic distance (MSA came from same or similar species). This approach is also conducted by Google DeepMind. After successfully generating MSA for complex proteins, the rest of predicting structures are the same as predicting single chain proteins. Here, the model for complex proteins have to be re-trained specifically for complex proteins, Google DeepMind use a seperate model for complex proteins too. Reflections: I really liked the idea of concatenating MSA into a big MSA. However, a drawback I initially thought of this approach is: forcibly connect two sequences may impact the accuracy of prediction as those two ends should never be connected together in nature. However, this may not greatly affect the predictions because deep learning models could detect contact of two amino acids that are far away. In other words, interactions of terminal amino acid residue of a chain can still be correctly predicted. My first intuition as a biologist to predict complex protein structures is: predict protein structure seperately and then add another model to predict connection between chains. If by my intial idea, this problem is divided into: 1. predict single chain protein structure 2. protein docking. Current protein docking programs heavily relys on human designed energy function and simulation (as most of the docking ligand would be a small molecule or macromolecules, not necessarily a protein molecule). To better exploit the fact that this is the interaction between proteins, MSA may still be the golden standard feature to work on. Drug Drug Interaction Predictions from Drug Labels \u00b6 Updated: 2021.05.01 This project is supervised by Prof. Karen Livescu from Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago . This project was take on as the final project for course Unsupervised Learning . Supervised learning methods are not allowed when approaching this project. Full code can be access here , the language processing model specifically trained for pharmaceutical text written for pytorch can be accessed here Side story: my grandfather is a real life victim of harmful drug drug interactions. I did this project for him and others who is currently suffering from unwanted drug drug interactions. Details: The goal of this project is to detect any drug drug interactions (DDI) for reducing the chance of overdosage and underdosage. The idea of this project is as follows. As a non-professional who is taking more than one drug, the medical professional may tell you if drugs can take together. This service is not readily available in most of areas especially in under-developed medical systems. The current method is: you have to read the drug labels thoroughly by yourself. The drug label includes any pre-determined drug interactions, its adverse effect and warnings etc.. With drug labels easily over 20 page, reading drug labels requires some basic medical understandings which is not applicable to everyone. The goal of this project is to have the computer read the labels instead human reading it. The pipeline of this project Build a natural language processing (NLP) model to read through pharmaceutical text and generate features for it. Build an unsupervised learning model to predict drug interaction from generated features Use current known DDI to test the robustness of it. Reflections: The NLP model trained using transformer model outperformed other text processing models on pharmaceutical text. The model I named as PharmaBERT. For PharmBERT performance, please read my final project report . The model can be accessed and downloaded from my google drive Due to the restriction of only using unsupervised learning methods, a very simple distance function/cost function and a cutoff value is designed to determine if there is a DDI. To better validate the idea of reading pharmaceutical text for DDI prediction, DDI section of the drug label is not read as input. When the decision based on the distance function is really strict, there can be correctly predicted DDI but recall rate is very low (most of the DDI is not predicted) I believe this project is mainly a proof of concept due to limited computational resources, time. However, the idea of using pharmaceutical text as an input features for drugs does work for some extent as a very simple classification algorithm do predict DDI to some extent. To better build a prediction model, here are a few suggestions I believe could work: Out of the most, switching from unsupervised learning to supervised learning. A supervised learning model would far exceeds the performance of an unsupervised learning models. A lot of drug labels actually includes DDI section. Incorporate those corpus as input features will largely increase accuracy. For those drug labels including DDI already, this problems switched from prediction problem to a pure text analysis problems. More feature other than drug labels text may added to better facilitate the prediction, such as biological systems, chemical structures etc. Later I may restart this project because I believe this could hugely facilitate drug usage and reduce unwanted drug effects. And instead of a model only predict if a DDI exists, a better model could developed to predict the tendency of the effect (amplified or reduced). Protein Side Chain Chi1 Angle Predictions \u00b6 Updated: 2021.03.01 This project is supervised by Prof. Yang Zhang from University of Michigan at Ann Arbor . Full code can be access here . Details: The Chi1 angle is the rotational angle/torsion angle of the chemical bond that connect amino acids side chain and its backbone. Accurately predict this angle would largely facilitate protein side chain's structure prediction. If the prediction is accurate, the value could be put into energy function for backbone structure prediction when doing Monte-Carlos (MC) simulation It is experimentally determined that there are only three possible conformations for Chi1 angle. It is either gauche+ (-60 degrees), gauche- (+60 degrees) or trans (180 degrees). All the chi1 angles follows normal distribution within these three classes. My thinking process/mind map is as follows: First of all, this prediction problem is a classification problem. There are a total of three classes of chi1 angle possible for each amino acid residue. Additionally, there are two main approaches for this problem. First method, template finding methods. (Find templates, or sequence similar enough, use found template to predict the chi1 angle) Second method, directly predicting chi1 angle from a model without using a templates. For template finding method: The bottleneck of this method is how to find good templates. There is not much to do in predicting part. Relatively easy to implement. By current multiple sequence alignment methods and find corresponding protein structure and its chi1 angles The prediction process will be relatively slow and memory intensive as you need to build a library for all the chi1 angle sequences and access it. For direct predicting method: Building a prediction model is relatively more difficult to implement. Training a good model may take a very long time. However, once the model is built, ran the program for prediction is relatively quicker. Out of the two methods, I choose the direct predicting method for the following reasons: For template finding method, after you found templates, you still need to build a model to predict the variable. Why not build a better model to predict it and use the templates as a input features. In this way, the direct predicting method could cover both aspects. By the time I am doing this project, there has been a recent success of using deep learning on predicting protein's backbone contacts using protein sequence evolutionary coupling information. By logics, this evolutionary coupling information could be useful for predicting chi1 angle as well. And this problem is a three-class classification problems which should not be too hard to fulfill. Another problem needs to be addressed is: each protein all have different lengths, when we predicting, do we only consider a fragment of the protein or consider the whole length from the benefit of convolution? Both methods are implemented and will discuss further. The accuracy of the prediction is about 67% which is far from useful in any applications. Predicts from fragments or the whole length does not affect accuracy that much. Random guessing accuracy is 46.34%, predict with most likely chi1 class has accuracy of 57.7% (each amino acid has a native preference of chi1 angle, not all three classes distributed equally) Reflections: From all the models tested and accuracy results, it suggest there is a weak relationship between sequence coupling information and chi1 angle. Unless there is a breakthrough of the model, the accuracy will probably around that range. I was not able to have a breakthrough until I started working with Jinbo Xu and he pointed out that deep learning model maybe excellent in extract weak relationship, however, good features will exponentially reduce the complexity and training time of a model. This problem have to be approached not only from data science perspective but also from biology perspective and put all the information into use. Current methods of predicting side chain structures all based on known protein backbone structure like SCWRL package. Therefore, input backbone structure information or have first part of the model training with backbone information or co-train backbone structure and chi1 angle will largely boost the efficiency when training the model. When I try to redo this project, Google DeepMind published its transcripts. That is exactly what Google DeepMind did -- predicting backbone together and chi-1 angle. Good lesson to learn here, when approaching a specific problem, when the model architecture don't work as good, either design a better architecture or better understand the problem and put better features in.","title":"Research Projects"},{"location":"research_details/#research-projects","text":"This page documents the thinking process (summary, details, my understanding and any reflections) of past and current projects.
